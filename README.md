# Garbage Handwriting Recognition

## How to run this?

First, get the dependencies: 
```pip install Pillow pytesseract```

Then run the code by: 
```python3 main.py```
Or 
```python main.py``` if you are on Windows.

Put your image in `images_test` directory and change the path name in the `main.py` file

**NOTE:** I will make it so that you can pass the path to the image via the command line as an argument. If I am unable to do it, feel free to make a PR yourself :D
